Would definitely go back!", "Great communication, friendly neighbors, clean condo and great location. Free parking on the premise. Easy check-in/out. Paul & Danny were transparent about a couch issue (which is in the works of being fixed) and offered a partial refund. They didn\u2019t have to do that, but\u2026Read more", "We had a wonderful stay, exactly what we needed. Loved having a parking space on the premises. Just walked down the street to catch the bus to the city. Paul and Danny were very communicative and their place was clean and comfy.", "Paul & Danny\u2019s place is amazing and I will really recommend it. It is super clean and very spacious. We had the greatest moment there. Very close from New York. Walking around the neighborhood is very safe. You really have to live this one and only experience staying at Paul & Danny\u2019s place.", "Nice apartment in a nice area, convenient to city.", "The place was super easy to find, very nice and cozy place, great communication, and they left plenty of information for getting around. Definitely would stay here again.", "Paul & Danny are amazing communicators. Gave us some great tips on getting around. The place was very clean and exactly what we needed!", "From the moment we booked, these guys were awesome! They made check in a breeze with a simple lock box. They answered the many many questions I had about the city and accommodations and were extremely helpful. They were even on vacation and helped with little things we had concerns about. It\u2019s a perfect distance away from the city and taking an Uber was about $30 (split between friends made it the obvious choice). You could take the ferry as well which was right down the street. The place is a bit smaller than expected but for me and my two friends just fine. The shower is phenomenal! We had a small issue with the pullout but they had the issue fixed within the day and made sure we were nothing but comfortable. 10/10! Thanks again for making our first NYC trip such a breeze! :)", "Awesome location right outside the city! Great suggestions and help from the hosts! Definitely take the ferry to the city!", "Paul and Danny were amazing hosts! They made my Airbnb experience smooth and pleasant by offering helpful tips and responding immediately to my messages. Their place was immaculately clean and comfy with up to date amenities.", "New to AirBnB. With a few changes, will be 5-star. *** PRO: Location; decor; lighting; good bed; full-sized fridge/stove/microwave & good A/C. Clean. Private parking is a huge convenience. Hosts are quickly accessible. *** CON : when we visited, shower doors needed adjustment to seal fully. NEEDS A GUEST BOOK WITH INSTRUCTIONS & LOCAL TIPS. We made a few other really minor suggestions to Paul & Danny.", "Exactly what we needed for a quick trip to NYC. Great location and the parking spot was awesome.", "Paul & Danny were great hosts! They were quick to respond when we had questions about transportation to Manhattan. Place is amazing and cozy. Neighborhood is safe and we really liked that the bus stop was two blocks away as well as other places. Close to an amazing view of New Yorks skyline. A huge help for us was not having to worry about parking, it was provided for us. If we ever consider coming again we will definitely consider staying here again. Highly recommend!", "This was the BEST AirBnB experience we\u2019ve had! Nice, clean space, solid WiFi, comfy bed, and a great shower with tons of hot water! The parking space made our trip so much easier, too! I definitely want to stay here again! Thanks, Danny and Paul, for a great experience!", "This place felt like a legitimate home away from home:) Aum aum was a great recommendation, and right across from it was a cuban cafe (Don Diego) that me and my husband went for breakfast. Their cafe con leche is a must have! The neighborhood is nice with lots of cute dog walking ppl. It is an 8$ uber away from the ferry to manhattan, and the 168 bus is a straight shot from the corner to New York manhattan. We like the ferry route:) Great place to stay.", "Very clean and cute spot to spend a night or two. The hosts were super helpful in giving directions to and from the city. Definitely would stay again!", "Great place", "This place was great! Very clean and has a lot of great accommodations. The hosts are great at communicating and respond very fast. Offer a lot of great suggestions on how to get to the city and things to do.", "Perfect location from new york, clean and quiet neighborhood. Would love to stay again.", "Absolutely perfect! This will be lengthy because I don\u2019t want to leave anything out. Paul and Danny are terrific hosts - great communication, flexible/easy/secure self check-in, and a spotless, cozy space that feels like home. Location: Do not hesitate to stay on the NJ side of the Hudson. This property is so convenient, safe, and easy to get to and park. On our hosts\u2019 advice we used both the NJ Transit bus and NY Waterways ferry (quick Uber ride to the port). The town is cute and the views of Manhattan from parks just several blocks away are breath-taking. Condo: The photos are definitely accurate, yet the place is actually even cuter in person. Uncluttered, stylish decor, excellent comfortable bed, couch and barstools. Nice hardwood floors, too! The bathroom is great - the glass shower has great pressure (that\u2019s a huge plus) and plentiful hot water. Full size appliances and a Keurig make the kitchen great to use. \u201cTech\u201d touches are nice - two large wall mounted flat screens (smart TV), cool mood lighting, and plenty of outlets. We also appreciated the thick towels, toiletries and coffee. There was soup, cereal and filtered water on hand, too! The building is quiet, we did meet the neighbors across the hall just once and they were super friendly and welcoming! If you drive, the parking space right next to the building (!!!) cannot be beat. Travel tips: Seriously don\u2019t skip the ferry. It runs all day, is $9 and takes only minutes to Manhattan (then you get a free bus to Times Square, Midtown or Downtown. ) I also suggest an unlimited subway pass . We did too much to list, but the Chelsea Highline is a must-see (and free!) Thank you Paul and Danny, we are already planning our return!!", "Paul & Danny's place was perfect for our quick trip up to the NYC area. The place was clean, cozy, and very accommodating. Plus, it's in a nice location. Quiet, but still close to the city which was great for us.", "The place was so cute and exactly what we needed after staying in hotels as we travelled from Texas to New York. Easy to get to NYC. Paul and Danny gave lots of tips for getting back and forth. They even left us a bottle of wine. Definitely recommend staying here and when I come back to the area will look to stay here first.", "Paul & Danny are great host beautiful clean home.. and we enjoyed our stay .. Paul and Danny a very quick to respond to any questions 5 star host!!", "Paul & Danny were very responsive. Awesome place. Bus was super easy to use to take into NY. We suggest going to Harrys Food and Drink in NJ about 6 mins from the house. Great vibes on a Friday night there! Place was super clean, safe neighborhood, nice neighbors, no issues. Would definitely recommend staying here.", "Good location to nyc and super nice host! check in and parking was a breeze!", "Great place to stay at overnight! Very clean and felt homey. They were great airbnb hosts, highly recommend!!", "What to expect when staying here is a clean, quiet location. Close to a number restaurants, culture that give you a true New Jersey feel. Enjoy your stay, I know I did.", "Paul and Danny have a fantastic little apartment that is so close to NYC with such easy access but not in the thick of things so we were able to get a wonderful night of badly needed sleep. There was plenty of room for us and they were so helpful with tips and suggestions for us out-of-towners who are not used to big city life. I was unable to be specific with our arrival and departure times and they were very understanding and flexible which was great. I would highly recommend their apartment to anyone visiting NYC or NJ. I\u2019m certainly tucking this gem away for our next visit here!", "Paul and Danny\u2019s place was in the perfect location for our NYC getaway. Easy access to the bus and ferry to the City. Their place is private, quiet, and has a parking spot. I highly recommend it if you\u2019re looking for a place to view the City from the other side of the river.", "Highly recommend booking! The rental was very clean with multiple amenities provided. While it took around 20-30 minutes to travel to NYC, Paul & Danny provided useful tips for traveling cheaply from the city and back. However overall if you want to save money but also want a very nice experience and quality rental you should definitely book!", "Danny & Paul had a great pad for tourist coming to NJ or NYC ! The place was spotless & the bed was super comfortable. There was so many stores in walking distance of the apartment, which was super helpful if you needed something quickly. Highly recommend this place! The only downfall was the pull out couch was super uncomfortable. Other than that everything was wonderful!", "Really great place; very clean and organized. I would 100% recommend this place.", "A beautiful place!!! We loved staying at this cute condo. Very close to NYC and in a safe area of town. Would recommend!!", "Staying at Paul and Danny\u2019s was a great experience. It was our first time to New York and we decided to stay in Jersey as it was only a short commute away. Both Paul and Danny were very helpful. They provided us with detailed instructions on how to get to their place and how to get to New York. If we had any questions they were super quick to respond and pleasant to interact with. The condo was in a quiet neighborhood and we felt safe walking to the bus stop and local restaurants. The place was perfect for two people and very well kept. It was stocked with plates, cups, and utensils which made it convenient for days we did not feel like eating out. There was also coffee to help us get a kick start to our day! I definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking to take a trip to Jersey or New York!", "Paul and Danny's condo is very clean. Their photos are true to life. They were most hospitable. The designated parking space for our car was a huge option for us. We enjoyed the round trip ferry service to NYC including after an evening Broadway show. We absolutely will return in the future.", "We loved everything about this rental! The communication was always quick and helpful. The space was just as described and very clean. Perfect location to hop on bus or get an Uber to the ferry to go into NYC. He met us in person upon arrival and was extremely helpful with tips on making the most out of our stay.", "Very clear check in instructions and a free parking spot! The place is really cozy and clean! Looks just like the photos. I really enjoyed my stay. Paul and Danny are very responsive to messages. I didn't have to message them too much but would feel confident that they would answer any questions you would have! I would love to book here again in the future if needed!", "The apartment was much better than I expected. It was perfect for my friend and I who planned a spontaneous trip! The place was super clean and it was great having a TV too which included netflix! Definitely recommend!", "Our stay at Paul and Danny\u2019s place was a very pleasant experience. The apartment was clean and adequate linens were provided. Communication was clear and getting into the apartment was easy. Access into New York City was easy as there are plenty of bus stations around the apartment (bus ride is about 30 minutes). Overall, I highly recommend staying at Paul and Danny\u2019s place if you are planning to stay in New Jersey.", "Paul and Danny's place was great. They are very quick to respond and are extremely hospitable! I'd recommend anyone looking for a great stay to check them out!", "Great place for two people. We parked our car and used public transportation all week. 3 min walk to bus. Felt safe in neighborhood", "Clean, well managed, nice location. Will strongly recommend", "This place was cute, clean, and quaint! Perfect for one or two guests, the check in process was a breeze. I recommend going to Sojo Spa and booking this place as it\u2019s so close! The hosts were quick with responses and very helpful. 10/10", "We loved our stay at Paul and Danny\u2019s. They keep it clean and it\u2019s easily accessible. The bed was comfortable and there was lots of spacious closet space.", "Paul & Danny have excellent instructions and communication. The place is generally clean but not well ventilated. They remedy this with a large air purifier and large air conditioning unit which gets the air cleaned up and flowing before too long. Parking is convenient. The neighborhood is residential and feels friendly and safe. We drove to the city or took an Uber. It\u2019s about 40 minutes door to door from most locations. The Uber to Manhattan is about $40 and on the way back it\u2019s $65. The layout is pretty good for a small space. Paul and Danny are definitely the best part of this booking. Next time I\u2019ll probably try a different one though thoroughly enjoyed the visit to NY.", "This is a lovely private airbnb. Fun little area, easily accessible to NYC without a car. Would highly recommend if you are in the area on business or for fun.

Lots of nice touches like bottled water, snacks in the fridge, hair products in the bathroom, etc. Great location close to subway stations and walking distance from lots of food, drinks, and sightseeing.

Appreciate the hospitality kind sir", "Michael is great. Helpful and upbeat. The place is closed to restaurants and the subway", "Michael was a very gracious and thoughtful host. His place was spotless. All the amenities expected were all there including a full sized ironing board! Also extras like any shower/grooming supplies you may have forgotten, umbrella, snacks & large map of the city.

The subway was a short walk away. Coffee shop right around the corner is definitely recommended! He had some snacks and drinks for us as an extra touch. He was quick to respond to any questions we had and overall really great! It was definitely an authentic NYC experience. You get what you see in the pictures. It is very small but for us it was just what we needed. We spent most of our time out exploring so it was a great place to use as a crash pad. We did hear some loud music from the apartment next door but it was off before 10pm. I would definitely recommend this place!", "Michael is the best! Super helpful and nice, perfect host.", "Michael is a great host. Very helpful. The place is clean and basic and located in a very convenient spot", "It's better than expected, for a studio it's extremely roomy there was food and drinks provided, tons of different products in the bathroom, the bed was incredibly comfortable I honestly haven't gotten such good sleep in a long time. Michael is incredibly friendly and funny and easy to communicate with. The building is safe as well you need to have a key to enter. I will definitely be coming back next time I'm up in the city. I really recommend you book his place if you get the chance! My only suggestion would be to put some sort of padding on the ladder to the bed but other than that everything was PERFECT.", "Good location, close to subway. Nice neighborhood, friendly people in the neighborhood who helped with directions and questions, pleasant host.", "Oh my god! This place is a must stay and SO CUTE! Michael is the best host I could have asked for very accommodating and sweet!", "Great place!

Great experience as first timers in New York. Definitely would stay here again on our next NY vacation without a doubt. Thank you Michael!!", "Michael was hands down the best Air BnB host I've experienced yet, by FAR. He greeted us with a helpful tour of the flat, assuring we knew where everything was. A fun rundown of the NY Metro System and easy to follow directions that made the commuting a piece of cake (he provides a big laminated map for you to use!). Snacks galore, super clean, bed was mad comfy, and I can go on... Forget a hotel, you'll get more with Michael. And the area in Harlem is awesome with amazing options for brunch and close to metro 2,3 Trains is all you need to get to the best spots in Manhattan for $3 a ride.", "Unique space in a great location", "Location is great! Very convenient to subway and some pretty good restaurants within walking distance. Also an interesting mix of newer and more traditional food and markets nearby which is nice. Very quiet street for NYC even though I was on the first floor. Michael is a great host. Parking is tough so either book ahead or don\u2019t bring a car. The space is great for one or two. Might be tight for more but this is a typical NYC studio sized place. Subway lines are super quick to Times Square. Whole Foods nearby as well as some great smaller markets that are a good value.", "Mike was super helpful with a quaint place that was close to all of beautiful Harlem, USA. We will return at our new home away from home.", "Great spot. Michael was very easy to get in touch with and quick with responses. He gives you a run down on the entire city with the map and tells you what subway to get on to go anywhere you want. Perfect for my first visit to NYC and definitely would stay here again.", "Great place to stay! Michael greeted me at the door and has plenty of information for anyone that doesn\u2019t know their way around the city. It\u2019s minutes away from a great subway line that goes all the way down Manhattan. Good food nearby, good coffee shop on the corner on your way to the subway. Everything you\u2019d need if you wanted to cook on site for a longer visit. Bed was comfy and clean, he made sure the place was warm enough when I got there. It\u2019s a great place for anyone that can get around the city confidently and needs a great base station to sleep and wash up.", "Place is dope. \u201cFloating bed\u201d and couches that pullout. He is funny, responds very quickly, & tries to accommodate as much as he can.", "Amazing hospitality from Michael.", "Our stay would have been a 5 star stay, had there not been ONE crucial instance of communication error. I give our stay a 3 star rating. Michael was awesome about communication, up to the day we saw him in person for our stay. He greeted my girlfriend and I with a big smile, and a helping hand with our luggage for our 9 day stay, as soon as we stepped foot out of our Uber. As soon as we got into our studio apartment, he had maps available for the area, and provided great tips about transportation and food options close by. He had a set of keys for both of us, and tons of water in the fridge for us to hydrate after our long trip in. The studio is quite small, but very functional. The main subway station we used to travel about the city, was only 4 blocks away; this was very convenient. The only issue we ran into with Michael was that about 4 days into our trip, we came home in the evening to find that our towels and trashes had been taken out in exchange for new/fresh replacements. This was a little embarrassing for us. The room was kind of a mess in result of being out every day from the morning, till the evening, on the \u201ctourist grind\u201d. Had our \u201cpersonal items\u201d not been exposed upon this visit, it may have not been that big of a deal to us; we just would have appreciated being notified that he was coming in. Maybe we\u2019re different, but our privacy is very important to us. I messaged Michael, and asked if he had come in the room for those items(making sure it was, in fact, him), and he answered back shortly after saying, \u201cYes\u201d. I then replied, hinting that \u201cI wish we would have known you were coming in....also, we had taken the trashes out before already, and we were in hopes that we put them in the right area..\u201d. This to me, was a subtle way of saying, please let us know before the next time you come in, so we can make sure our personal clothing is not out and the room looks decent. For the first time, Michael did not respond back. We came home the very next night, after a long day in the city, to find store bought muffins sitting on the table; still no reply to my message. We really weren\u2019t sure how to react to this. It\u2019s his house, his stuff, I get it.... but it made us feel super awkward like he was just gonna come in at any given point, unannounced, and that\u2019s just the way it was. All in all, I feel as if this awkward feeling could have easily been avoided by a quick message to just let us know. Michael was very polite and very professional in person. Also, he was super cool and seemed very flexible in other conversations we had prior to the incident I explained. I don\u2019t think he did any of that to be malicious or purposely make us uncomfortable, but it did.", "Great host!", "Michael was super friendly, gave us wonderful tips for our visit to the city, and the place was wonderful. Highly recommend.", "Awesome location, extremely hospitable and kind host. Would definitely stay again!", "really close to transportation", "Let me start off by saying that Micheal is super friendly and welcoming... but that does not make up for the poor experience that we had at his place. This place is extremely small and the pictures don\u2019t elude to the actual size of the place, so when we got there we were taken aback. We might have been able to deal with the size -if it wasn\u2019t for the bathroom. The bathroom was unfit for guests on a platform like Airbnb. Me and my boyfriend were so uncomfortable that we decided to leave the next morning and not complete our stay! We also did not inform Micheal that we were unhappy with his place, and we did not request a refund for the night that we did not stay there (we booked two nights but only stayed for one). The shower had body wash and a heavily used shower puff as well as a bath mat with a few tiny hairs at the bottom of the tub! The floors also need to be cleaned. The bathroom needs a complete and thorough clean and clearing- there are a lot of products on the shelving and in the shower. The place seems like someone lives there full time. There is a thick layer of dust on the ceiling fan and the ladder that you use to get in and out of the bed is quite uncomfortable without shoes. Overall if you need a place to stay for one (two nights max) it\u2019s okay for one or two people but it\u2019s super tiny and not very tidy. A cheaper hotel would be about the same price and much better value for money. Micheal however has an awesome personality and I can see why he has such good reviews. The only problem I had with him was getting in contact with him on the day of check in... luckily he answered my call right as I was walking up to the place so that was fine.", "This place gets 5 stars for two main reasons: 1-price is right! And it was so easy to walk or take the subway from here. And 2-Michael is an amazing host! He is accommodating, responsive, friendly, gave us snacks and an awesome welcome complete with instructions on how to use public transit from there and things to do in the area that met our interests. This guy is tops!!! The place is tiny (helloooo NY haha) but it\u2019s a super comfy bed with a good shower which is really all you probably need it for anyway! It\u2019s clearly older and while decorated super cute, everything is very simple and basic. You\u2019re not going here for granite counter tops or fancy furniture. ;] But again for the price, and how awesome Michael is, it was just what we needed.", "Michael had great communication and tips for getting around the city. His place had everything we needed and was in a GREAT location! 4 quick blocks to the subway station/bus to LGA. Would definitely stay here again!", "All the reviews were accurate. Michael is the friendliest host, and his place is in an ideal location: close to restaurants and TWO major subway lines. He mentioned that a couple of previous guests had commented on the noise at night. I travel with ear plugs so it wasn't really a problem for me, and I am used to a big city. Be sure to eat at Jacob's Restaurant on the corner!", "Very friendly and peaceful! We loved the snacks!", "It is quite apparent upon arrival why Michael is a Superhost. He is very flexible with arrival and departure times. He has food available for you, i.e. waffles, coffee, jams, butter, spices, snacks, and cold water in the refrigerator. Also, the bathroom has every kind of toiletry you might need (from toothpaste, to sunscreen, etc.). The studio is very comfortable and tastefully decorated and has air con and every cable channel you could want. There are good restaurants and a Whole Foods Market nearby. I used the subway extensively and the Lenox/W 125th subway station is 4 blocks away which connects you to anywhere you would want to go. Also, I took the M60 bus to LaGuardia Airport. The bus stop for M60 is only 4 blocks from the studio. Use the MYMTA app to plan what routes to take for getting around New York. The one week unlimited pass for $33 dollars was well worth it.", "5 stars", "Funky and in a great location.

A few blocks from the subway station, this apartment is great for cheap transportation to the many attractions in the city. Good restaurants, fast food chains, grocery stores, drug stores, dress shops and food trucks are all within a few blocks. I highly recommend Michael's places and Michael, too.", "Everything about Michael's place was spot on - the pics and description are fully accurate. I was there as a woman with my young niece and it was a safe and welcoming neighborhood and the building was secure. Michael was constantly available to answer questions. Subway and grocery and plenty of restaurants are within walking distance and the place is clean, cozy and the beds very comfortable. Linens were fresh and Michael has thought of everything, even adding power strips for extra outlets, having multiple remotes, pens and paper, as well as snacks and food/drinks for guests (plus maps and guide books for the city).

The place is one of the cheapest places to stay in NY. 2. Good diverse restaurants located nearby. Cons: 1. Easily the dirtiest Airbnb I\u2019ve ever stayed in. Dust covered everything (floor, microwave, walls, etc.). The bathroom has old crusty shaving cream all over the walls. The bathtub had mold. Flies were all throughout the house. 2. The neighborhood was very loud and sketchy. Sirens went past every 5 minutes, and people were loud outside well into the night. I walked to Papa Johns about a block away and a man tried to sell me drugs. The door of the apartment was often unlocked which didn\u2019t make me feel super safe. 3. The bed was extremely uncomfortable and hard. You can feel the bedsprings, and it is very similar to sleeping on the floor. Conclusion: This place is not for extended stays. If you need a place overnight, this is a cheap simple solution but you must be desperate and have exhausted all other options.", "not bad for the price however disappointed with the cleanliness of the whole place, nothing like the photos", "Jj is a great host, very welcoming and makes you feel at home", "Our stay with JJ was a very good experience.

I know this place has a lot of good reviews but I stayed at Jj's place two weeks ago and it was SUPER dirty. The room had so much dust, crumbs debris on the floor. The bathroom was even worse. It was an older apartment which is fine by me which means some of the bathroom has worn out stuff but the bathroom was so dirty. There was black gunk(mold or something gross) on the wooden mat. So much dust throughout. The tub had so much hair and other old product on the tub and the sink was super dirty too. It looked like it had really old toothpaste all over. The mirror was dirty. The bathroom was super dusty too. Worst the light in the bathroom did not turn on so you had to bring in your own flashlight to use the bathroom at night it was insane. I ended up leaving after one day because I could not stand it. I told the host and they apparently cleaned it and wanted me to come back but I did not want to come back and it would of taken so much time and effort and taken so much more time out of my vacation for me to uber back and haul my stuff up four floors.", "the location is convinence", "#Catfished The pictures online of the unit WILL NOT BE what you get!!

I talked to Maggie about it and she quickly left us a little fan to use and instructed me on how to use the window AC. We were able to sleep more comfortably for sure.

Easy communication with remote entry. Bathroom was pretty big for NYC and very clean. Will totally stay here again.", "Good location in a fun neighborhood, a diamond in the rough", "If you\u2019re looking for a very old style NYC experience, Charles\u2019 place will be perfect. It reminds me of the cozy hostels I shared in Montreal. Great location in Williamsburg. Worked out as a perfect crash pad for a wedding I attended at the Wythe Hotel just a few blocks away, and had plenty of cafes nearby for the morning after. I was in the smallest room, which is tiny but perfect for a short term stay. The larger rooms looked quite nice and would certainly have booked if one had been available. Other guests were friendly and respectful of shared space. Overall would recommend.", "Great space - I would absolutely stay here again. Close to everything. Good amount of privacy even though the apartment hosts other guests.", "Great spot lots of great places to eat", "This place is in a great location. Such a lively area with plenty of shops and some of the best restaurants I\u2019ve ever been to. The area also has a very artsy vibe which was really cool.", "Great location!", "very convenient and clean, a good place to stay", "Great space, very convenient to the L train!", "Perfect for what I needed. The space was clean, quiet and safe.", "Everything was as described. This place is in a nice neighborhood with easy access to the subway and it is near my food options.", "The space was beautiful!!", "Pictures don't show how truly charming this apartment is. It's filled with beautiful photos and the upstairs deck is large and great for entertaining . The apartment is 2 minutes walk from the L line and is located in a really fun area of Williamsburg. Looking forward to coming back.", "Charles was super great with communication and directions for how to navigate around the space. The place is right in the middle of Williamsburg and a great place to be. The room is quaint and cozy, there is a clothes rack and the ceiling can open up to fresh air! The room can get pretty warm but there is a ceiling fan and also a desk fan which came in handy. I only stayed for one night but I noticed there was a projector system and tons of movies in the living room. The outdoor terrasse is super nice as well. No problems with the space, though when I went into the building there were two huge Amazon shipping boxes blocking the stairwell. They probably won't be there forever, but if that is the case, it could be a nuisance to go around with luggage. Definitely would recommend!", "I stayed here for one night while in greater Brooklyn for work - amazing location. Charles's place got the job done. I was in the small bedroom - a bit smaller than advertised so if traveling with a partner I would avoid this room. Very clean.", "Charles\u2019s place was great. The room was small but everything was clean, which is more important. Perfect for a person or couple that want to get out and explore Williamsburg. Charles was very communicative via text and helpful when necessary. The communal space and outdoor area was really nice as well.", "This place is an excellent value. The room is very basic, but the apartment is actually quite charming. It\u2019s an older building so don\u2019t expect anything fancy, but it\u2019s all well kept and functional. Of course it\u2019s NYC, so you should be out exploring, not sitting in the apartment. I basically just slept and showered at the place and then spent the rest of the time wandering around NYC. Why get a fancy hotel you\u2019re barely going to be in? Spend that money you saved on a Broadway show, visiting the Met and more beer and pizza. The apartment is conveniently located by plenty of restaurants, cafes, parks, bars, night clubs, and public transportation. I\u2019ll definitely be seeing if this is available the next time I go to NYC. This area of Williamsburg is a spot to be and only a 3 block walk and 1 train stop away from the Lower East Side of Manhattan.", "The location of the airbnb was perfect for my stay in Williamsburg. I love the neighborhood and was close to some of my favorite shops and restaurants- Le Labo, Cafe Mogador, Maison Premiere, 10ft single by stella dallas, catbird, etc... The nearest metro is a short 5 minute walk from the apartment which was very convenient for when I met my friends in Manhattan. The apartment was easy to get to and Charles left excellent instructions on how to get into the building. I also had the pleasure of meeting him while I was there and had a couple nice morning chats over coffee before heading out for the day. Overall, I highly recommend this space and only wish that it had been warmer during my stay so that I could have enjoyed the outdoor seating area. Can't wait to go back!", "Stylish place at great location.", "This apartment is ideally located in Williamsburg. The flat is warm, and the sunlit living area exceptional. So much to do in the neighborhood, and so easy to get downtown. I recommend Bakeri for Coffee and Pastry, and Artichoke for a stellar slice of pizza. And - for an amazing night view - make a reservation at The Ides Bar at the Wythe Hotel (if no reservation, there\u2019s a $10 cover). You won\u2019t regret it. Thank you Charles, for sharing your lovely apartment! I can\u2019t wait to return!", "Fantastic, thanks!", "Charle\u2019s place was nice with lot of sunlight. The neighborhood was busy with lots of good places to chill at a walkable distance. Will definitely recommend.", "Great location, with homey vibes!", "Great location and apartment, and a very helpful host.", "I absolutely loved this apartment and it's location! Super close to the metro and tons of cafe's, shops, and places to eat, I fell in love with Williamsburg! I met some amazing people (including someone staying in one of the other rooms), and had the time of my life! The room was cozy and the apartment had everything I needed! Also, the outdoor space out back (which I didn't see until my last day), was AWESOME! Will definitely be back!

A wonderful experience overall.", "Joris was a great host! He responded quickly if I had any questions or concerns. He also let us check-in early. We dropped off our luggage in the apartment and he had someone come in later morning to clean the apartment from the previous guest. There were noises coming from the floor above, mainly footsteps. But, it didn\u2019t bother us since it quieted during the night. If we make another trip to New York, we would definitely book Joris\u2019s apartment again.", "Joris place is absolutely amazing! Very clean and spacious. Its very private and easy to access. Joris add amazing tips and respond quickly to message. The place might seem far but is close to the metro and communte is not that long. Overall my family and I had a great time here.", "Amazing space! Was HUGE and at such a great price. Short walk to the nearest subway station. We felt very safe and loved that it took a key fob, another key to a hallway, and yet ANOTHER key to get into the space. Very secure and safe. Shower was also very pleasant and the room was very comfortable.", "Joris' hospitality was absolutely amazing. The place is within walking distance of many convenience stores, shops, and hole-in-wall restaurants so we had plenty of dining options every night of our 4-day stay. The upstairs neighbors can be kind of loud and the walls are kind of thin so I would suggest ear plugs if you are a light sleeper, but that is a situation over which the owner of this cute apartment has no control so I definitely did not dock him any points for. Just thought I'd share. If I were to visit NYC again, I would hands-down stay with Joris again!", "Great little place! Perfect place to stay outside of the city. Definitely would return.", "Great place! More than suitable for myself and my guest. The place was nice and clean, comfy beds, and just an overall great area to relax as that was mainly just a place for me to sleep at night. Joris provided every essential item needed for a great stay! Far more Pros then Cons.. My only con had nothing to do with the room or the host, but in fact, with the neighbors who stay on the floor directly above. A lot of loud noise and heavy footsteps at night. Other than that, great place to stay and I would recommend this place to others!", "This apartment was wonderful value, exactly what we needed. Parking was a bit tricky as we were not from NY, but we were able to figure it out and Joris offered us suggestions for parking. He was very responsive and accommodating and wanted to make sure we had all we needed. Overall a great stay!", "We came to New York for our 12th Anniversary. We expected to walk a lot and we did, we also got the subway experience. The subway took a day or 2 to get the hang of it but overall we had a great time. Jori, had everything ready for us when we got there and let us keep our bags at his place while we spent a little more time in the city. I say it was well worth the money compared to staying in downtown New York. I would recommend this place again.", "I found Joris\u2019s home and instantly booked on the same day. The price was the main reason but when checking in, the apartment during our stay was very homey & cute. We had an early flight and although check in is at 3:30, Joris was kind enough to let us leave our luggage while the apartment gets cleaned and we were able to stay locally. The area is very quiet, has nearby restaurants (highly recommended Rudy\u2019s bakery less than 3 mins away). The apartment does have its own entrance & is separate from Joris\u2019s own apartment. Privacy is really important and he did not bother us not once & vice versa as we were only there to sleep & eat. I will be going to NY very soon again & planning on staying here again if it is available.", "Great hospitality, Joris was willing to help and give instructions about checkout and how to move around the city. Spacious and clean", "This place was an amazing value! Joris was a great host and so helpful! He let us leave our luggage there since we got in earlier than check in which was wonderful! His instructions and directions were spot on! If you don't mind taking the subway into Manhattan this is a wonderful place to stay! We explored the neighborhood of Ridgewood the first night we were there and really enjoyed it as well! I never felt unsafe walking around at night. I will definitely be recommending this place to my friends who want to travel to NYC.", "Very informative informative, polite and gave extra towels when I asked.

Detailed and very clean!", "The unit was clean and accurate to the photos. Easy access to 2 subway lines and lots of markets and restaurants nearby. Check in procedure was simple.

Joris was very helpful throughout our stay and solved our small issues very fast.", "Joris was an excellent host! The apartment and location was great. The subway is a couple of blocks away, and around the corner is an array of stores and food establishments. We felt very safe walking around the neighbor, day or night.

He offered great tips of where to go and how to get their!", "Really enjoyed staying with Joris. Highly recommend", "Joris is very kind and communicative and his place is clean and has all necessary amenities in. I recommend this place if you're fine with taking trains to Manhattan for about 30 mins. It's a good deal considering the price and location.", "For the value of staying in New York over a couple of days this is a great value. However you have to sacrifice some things. The walk to the subway is 8 minutes. It can be tiring after a long day of walking. Getting back at night made me feel uneasy because the streets weren\u2019t well lit. Overall a decent place for the price.", "Great location and communication", "This Airbnb is great if you don't want to stay in Manhattan.

Listen to joris directions about the city and your trip will be much easier and painfree.", "Wonderful place to stay. Close to shops and also close to transit. Stylish space and great to stay with friends. Joris was amazing and patient when there was a mixup on my end. Would recommend this place wholeheartedly.", "The place was fantastic and well as the hospitality.", "This Airbnb was perfect for a quick stay! Everything was walking distance and we got literally everywhere that we wanted to go :) Joris is really friendly and responsive.", "The apartment itself was great, but it was 40 minutes atleast to the city and not in a safe neighborhood.", "Joris place is clean and quiet, a good place to get away from the noise of the city. Within a short walking distance of the subway and buses. We felt very safe in the area and it was less than a block to shopping, restaurants, and frozen yogurt. I would stay here again.", "Nice place. Easy walking distance to subway. Basement apartment so it was a little musty, but not too bad. No top sheets on bed so the comforter was what you covered up with at night, which is fine if they are washed after each visit. All in all it was just as described.", "Amazing room. Close to cheap food, eazy subway acces, and well decorated. I'd love to stay here again.", "Joris's place was very clean and comfortable. He responded quickly to all my messages and was a very good host. I would stay here again.", "Joris' place was awesome. The decor was very clean and modern. His communication was quick and precise. The place is a bit far and secluded from nightlife and the restroom was small, but for the price it was terrific.", "The price is perfect for one just needing a place to sleep as you venture out!", "Me and my friends really enjoy our staying. Joris was a wonderful host and helpful since the beginning. We really appreciate his efforts to make us comfortable. The place is nice- exactly like the pictures, the neighborhood has all the essentials and there is 3 subway stations in a walking distance of less than 10 minutes.", "Joris was a great host. Answered questions promptly. My husband and him became quick friends :) The subway is about a 10 minute walk. We never felt unsafe walking to or from. Traveled with our 14 and 17 year old son's. About 30 to Manhattan. The place was spotless and smelled clean upon entering. WiFi did not work well in the back bedroom, but was fine elsewhere. Make sure you lock the door when you are in the apartment. We did not once and a little girl came in while we were watching TV. Joris had complimentary shampoo and conditioner for us which was nice. Make sure you understand the street parking rules if you drove.", "My boyfriend and I stayed here for a little less than a week, and really enjoyed ourselves! The check-in and check-out process was easy, and the apartment itself was very charming! It had all the essentials and more! Joris was very quick in responding to my questions, which I very much appreciated! One thing we didn't like, but we understand was completely out of Joris' control was that the hot water would run out in the morning when we tried around 8-9. We'd advise to shower at night, that way you get hot water and get to sleep in a little bit in the morning haha. Other than that, this is a great place!", "Great place, it was clean and spacious. Also, it comes with all the things one would most likely need. The only issue was the wifi was a little slow but that's not a biggie.", "Great location and great neighbor! Communication is done well! Joris was a wonderful host!", "Recommended", "The place was great, clean, and as expected. Joris was very informative and gave great advices on things to do/ see.", "The host canceled this reservation 11 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.", "I really enjoyed my stay! The apartment had plenty of room for my friend and I. The beds were comfortable. The refrigerator and microwave definitely came in handy for late night snacks. I will say that the bathroom is a little tight, but this is just an observation, not a complaint. There was a fun bar around the corner and the subway station was just a short walk. We had no trouble finding a parking space and always felt safe in the neighborhood. I'll definitely consider staying here again the next time I visit the city. Also, Joris was a great host. He provided very clear instructions on how to check in and he also contacted me the next day to see how everything was going.

I highly recommend staying with Jeffrey. He is a a very caring person.", "Jeffrey has made his little space into a unique artist's studio that you will find interesting, especially if you like colorful art. You will be right in the middle of it but it is interesting to see his process. He is a colorful character himself and makes a delicious breakfast. The room is very cozy but will have noise- an air handler next door but that's the city and the white noise is much preferred to sirens. One of my best airbnb experiences ever! I will be back.", "Jeff\u2019s place is fun and different than most places you have been. Given he\u2019s an active artist, you feel immersed in new creations and can learn about the process of dyeing silk. Nice hanging out for bagels ( or bialys) and good strong coffee in AM. Very laissez faire attitude which is great. Bed is comfy. Not a sterile hotel room for sure. Character in spades. Value for NYC is at the far end of the spectrum.", "Jeffrey was an outstanding host.

I would absolutely stay here again.", "Didn't realize host was going to be sharing the space. Turned out to be one of the nicest, most genuine, and truly cool person I've ever met.

Was accommodated on my unusual check in schedule with a smile. zero complaints.", "Sweet", "Where to start, Jeff is the embodiment of what a genuine New Yorker is supposed to be. I came at 5:00 am and he had no problem taking my bags until check in which saved a lot of pain and I couldn\u2019t thank him enough. He doesn\u2019t intrude on personal space and respects your boundaries. He showed me how silk screening printing works and loved the experience. He won\u2019t bother you while you stay in his comfortable space, he even cooks your breakfast and can brew a mean cup of joe, and converses about anything you\u2019re willing you open up too and is a great story teller. I highly recommend this space for those willing to explore the true meaning of New York but nevertheless it will be an experience you\u2019ll never forget. Thank you Jeff for your accommodating stay, the silk shirts, and the unforgettable memories.", "Jeffrey was an amazing host!

It's also close to many restaurants and grocery stores (including a Trader Joe's)... as well as 5th Avenue shops. It's a great place for a solo traveler - clean and very private with a separate entrance. For NY standards, it's a decent-sized room, with a bed, desk, and drawers (pictures are accurate). There's plenty of hangers provided, and clean towels are provided weekly. A cleaning person comes every 2 weeks. There's great water pressure in the shower. Tracy herself is very responsive and helpful. She kindly retrieved a package for me and also helped to fix the door lock.

The entrance is practically private and the room is cozy comfortable. Great location. Given the chance to return, I'd definitely be there.", "I stayed with Tracy for a month while in NY for work, and I cannot say enough good about my experience. She was so accommodating, from the moment of arrival to departure, making sure I was comfortable and inquiring about what I might need or want. The bedroom, bathroom, and hallway are a little cluster separate from the rest of the apartment, on the other side of the shared kitchen. The separate entrance makes it feel all the more private. A mini-fridge gives you your own space in the kitchen, and she also supplies you with your choice from every kind of tea. She has stocked the bathroom and bedroom with all the supplies that could possibly be needed during a short or long stay, including toiletries, desk supplies, iron and ironing board, and books. The space and the linens were very clean. There is plentiful shelf, drawer, and closet space--I brought quite a bit of luggage and there was easily room for everything. The wifi connection is excellent and worked perfectly for my entire stay. The apartment is located in a safe and friendly building with laundry on site. The location can't be beat, as it is both close to everything in mid-Manhattan yet in a residential area. Murray Hill is lovely, safe, with plentiful affordable food options including Indian restaurants and groceries, kosher delis, organic GF options, and cheap groceries at the nearby Trader Joe's. The 6 train is a mere 4 blocks away, free talks at CUNY Graduate Center only 3 blocks away, and the Morgan Library also only 3 blocks away. Heaven. In the end, however, it all depends on the host. Tracy is gracious, warm, personable, and smart, with a depth of NY experience and knowledge. I'm grateful to have been able to stay with her and recommend her listing whole-heartedly.", "I stayed in Tracy's apartment from December 18th- January 17th and it was absolutely amazing!! To start, Tracy is a kind and helpful host who does everything she can to make sure you feel at home. The room is the perfect space; very private, has fresh sheets and towels, a private bathroom, and a closet. You also have your own entrance and Tracy was kind enough to leave the lights on for me when I would be out late. Her apartment is located right in Murray Hill and I was within a short walking distance to all the major subways. Whenever I'm staying in the city Tracy's will always be my first go to!!!", "I loved staying at Tracy's! So cozy, cute and private. I really felt spoiled and probably could have stayed there forever.

Thanks for your flexibility!", "Tracy was waiting for me when I arrived and we had a chance to get to know each other a little bit before I settled in. The room was as described. Technically it was the maid's room off of the kitchen in a classic NYC apartment. I liked the privacy it provided as it was right off the kitchen and had a private entrance. The room was pretty warm as many rooms can be in pre-war buildings but there was a window I could open.", "Great place to stay and great host! The place had everything I needed for a multi-day stay in NYC and was private and conveniently located! The host, Tracy, was very friendly, flexible and good communication. Would definitely stay here again if visiting anywhere in Manhattan.", "Tracy is a most approachable and friendly host. Her apartment's location is very convenient within the city, and I found the room itself to have every convenience a guest might need (hair dryer, iron & board, TV, wifi, air conditioning, hand soap, suitcase luggage rack, towels, you name it!). I appreciated the ensuite bathroom arrangement, and there's also ample closet and shelf space. Perfect for a solo traveler. And I can second Tracy's recommendation of the excellent coffee & espresso drinks at Lucid Cafe, a short walk away!", "I had a very enjoyable stay. It was very relaxing and Tracy was very welcoming. The neighborhood is very friendly and accessible to all parts of town. Within walking distance of East River Ferry and main subway lines uptown and downtown. I would recommend Airnb to others and would recommend Tracy also. This was the perfect way to stay in New York for a single women. I moved to the Roosevelt for a few days to attend a conference and wish I had kept my airnb room. I will definitely do this again. Thank you Tracy for such a great NYC experience.", "Tracy's apartment is just what I was looking for- clean, private and located exactly where I needed to be.

There are lots of shelf and cabinet space and hooks and hangers for one's clothes. The place is easily accessible to major points of interest in the city. Room is sufficiently private and right beside a cozy kitchen and dining nook space. I would certainly go back here anytime.", "Tracy's place was lovely!

Heating was good and I was very satisfied. Tracy's meticulous care also impressed me.", "I will be back!!!.

You will certainly enjoy it here!", "Tracy's place is awesome. About a 8 min walk to grand central station, a starbucks and a good deli place a fewblocks away.

I highly recommend for solo travellers in NYC", "It\u2019s an amazing place close to everything in manhattan, Very nice old house, the room is small and there is not a lot of light inside because is in the back side and with a small window. But there is an own bathroom and this was very important for me, You have everything you need in the small room, and I could use the kitchen with own refrigerator, and taste and drink the amazing teas from Tracy! I am often in New York / Manhattan and this is a very good option! I come sure back again when I am in the city , thank you Tracy", "Tracy's place was perfect for a month stay in the big apple; super close to everything and the 6 subway line, with great food just blocks away (definitely try Momosan ramen and the 99c pizza on 34th!) and a CVS or Duane reade minutes away + other ammenities you may need. Laundry in the basement too which is much cheaper than other laundromats around the area. Can't recommend this place enough if you're looking for a decently priced place to stay on Manhattan with your own private bathroom that's close to everything. Tracy is super nice, and sorted out any issues I had (which were very few) and was overall just a lovely host. Thanks again Tracy!", "Tracy\u2019s place was perfect!

Would definitely stay again!", "Tracy is a great host. She showed me around when I got in. All the little touches are great. There is a small fridge in the kitchen where you can put things. This was extremely handy. There are towels/toiletries, pen/paper/map/Mirrors/hangers/tv/radio/drawers/lamps etc in the bedroom. Everything you\u2019d get in a hotel. I don\u2019t usually stay in Airbnb so this was a pleasant surprise. The bed and pillow are super we comfy so I slept well. There is also an air con in the room. Tracy allowed me to use the kitchen which was nice. As a tea addict it meant I can make a cup of tea when I like rather than going to Starbucks. The shower pressure is great. Location is perfect. The place is about 5-7 mins walk to grand central/Madison garden & about 10-20 mins walk to Times Square if you know which way to go. Initially I made it long for myself by going round in circles but actually it\u2019s a long straight road down. Tons of shops/cafes/supermarket nearby. Only downs- there isn\u2019t much natural light into the room as window is small. The bedroom sink pressure is low so takes forever to use. It\u2019s a building with a lot of students & on two nights there were a lot of shouting & music outside my window as people partied in their balcony. Luckily I took earplugs which I\u2019d advise. There was also loud water gushing noises coming from somewhere at night. I thought it was air con or tap but never did find out what it was- again earplugs come in handy. The bedroom door is difficult to open and close, it\u2019s really stiff & needs a bit of force Overall great experience & I loved the comfy room and cute kitchen. I would stay again!", "Tracy\u2019s home is ideal for a stay in Manhattan. It is very centrally located to all the major attractions and useful public transport, but is set in a peaceful area with all necessities near by.

Great host and superb location.", "This room is located at the very very top of a 5 story walk up- if you have a lot of luggage, the stairs definitely suck. There\u2019s also a private rooftop deck for Joe\u2019s place which is rad and has a pretty view of the city. When my boyfriend and I stayed here, it did feel a little awkward. Joe is present while you\u2019re there and the space is really small so privacy is kinda ehhh. He was chillin with a friend and they were being super quiet (not something i really care about at all). I didn\u2019t learn this until I was already in NYC and had paid for the AirBNB that most AirBNBs are ILLEGAL in NYC. I think the law is that the permanent tenant must be present for it to be legal, so word to anyone staying in the city- tenants will probably have to be present. Joe had another guest in one of the rooms and he was chill. Sheets and pillows smelled dusty and a little weird- probably not totally clean. Overall, this experience was pretty average. Kinda wished I had stayed elsewhere but I also had food poisoning from NORMAN\u2019S CAFE in Brooklyn (don\u2019t ever go there) so my perspective may be a little skewed. I am skeptical in general when it comes to AirBNB hosts in big cities- I feel like a lot of them are creepy and I didn\u2019t necessarily get that vibe from Joe, which was relieving. The shower is gnarly- the slightest adjustment, and the water gets unbearably boiling hot. My boyfriend scorched his back and was real sensitive for a few hours. Water temp literally went from 0-100 real quick, and then back and forth on its own- so shower CAUTIOUSLY.", "Joe was very hospitable.

Check was very easy and communication was thorough. It's also in a great location if you like nightlife. That said, even though it's on the 4th floor, you do get a good amount of street noise from the bars and restaurants before. Tim is really understanding and provided me some earplugs in my room.

It was also great to have a laundromat right on the same block. The bedroom was surprisingly spacious for the area and we had no problem fitting our two large suitcases without feeling too cramped. Tim met us at the apartment and check in was easy. The only downsides are what we already knew going in: loud at night, especially on the weekend, and lugging suitcases up and down to the 4th floor. But Tim provided earplugs and we slept very well. We both found the bed to be super comfortable.", "Tim's place was sparkling clean and smells very nice which immediately made me feel comfortable.
