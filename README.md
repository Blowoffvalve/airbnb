# Airbnb prediction
I'm writing a rating prediction application for Airbnb that will have the following components when it is done
1. A listing details extractor that creates a dictionary for each listing
2. A listing writer that formats and writes the listing dictionary to file. This is to allow you decide what elements from the listing you want to write to a file.
3. A machine learning algorithm for predicting the rating of an algorithm using only textual data. This should only use the textual data.
4. If a regular machine learning algorithm doesn't suffice, a deep learning algorithm to use NLP and computer vision to attempt to gather additional features.
